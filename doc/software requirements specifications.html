<big><u><b>Introduction</b></u></big>

	<big><u>1.1 Purpose</u></big>
		OpenGalaxies was created with the intent of creating a software suite used to emulate the most under-appreciated MMORPG of the decade: Star Wars Galaxies.

	<big><u>1.2 Scope</u></big>
		Although the lower-level software components of this project can be used to create different versions of the game, with little to no modification, 
		the scope of this project is to develop a PreCU ( Publish 14 ) implementation of the game.
		
	<big><u>1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations</u></big>
		<b>SWG</b> - Star Wars Galaxies

	<big><u>1.5 Overview</u></big>
	
	
<big><u><b>Overall Description</b></u></big>

	<big><u>2.1 Product Perspective</u></big>
		This product is based off of the game Star Wars Galaxies, all documentation known thus far can be found at <a href="http://wiki.opengalaxies.org">our wiki</a> as well
		as other locations around the internet.
	
	<big><u>2.2 Product Functions</u></big>
		
	
	<big><u>2.3 User Characteristics</u></big>
		The software is designed for people who wish to host their own Star Wars Galaxies private server. The software is intended to be used
		by experienced Server Administrators. As well, this project was created as an educational experience; programmers wanting to learn 
		the techniques used in creating large-scale multi- threaded/proecess applications also apply as a user.
	
	<big><u>2.4 Constraints</u></big>
		One of the biggest contraints the software faces is bandwidth, so it is very important that messages be packed and compressed as tightly as possible. Another
		contraint is the amount of available RAM, therefore, it is critical that we manage memory correctly and be as lightweight as possible with the storage of runtime elements.
	
	<big><u>2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies</u></big>
		Our software depends on the following software libraries/packages:
			<b>Boost</b> - A multitude of Boost libraries are used for this project, such as ASIO, UUID, Config, and more. These libraries are generic, multiplatform solutions.
			<b>Qt</b> - These libraries will be used for tool development. They are a multiplatform GUI solution.
			<b>CMake</b> - This software package is used to generate build and IDE files.
			<b>CPPUnit</b> - These libraries are used for testing. They are a testing framework.
	
<big><u><b>Specific Requirements</b></u></big> 
	
	<big><u>3.1 External Interface Requirements</u></big>
	
		<big><u>3.1.1 User Interface</u></big>
			
		
		<big><u>3.1.2 Hardware Interface Requirements</u></big>
			No Minimum Hardware Specifications are available at this time.
		
		<big><u>3.1.3 Software Interface Requirements</u></big>

		
		<big><u>3.1.4 Communications Interface</u></big>
		
		
	<big><u>3.2 Functional Requirements</u></big>
		<big><b>3.2.1 Server Framework (Generic)</b></big>
			<Req_1> The software shall provide interfaces, in which server programmers can create plugins to extend server functionality.
			<Req_2> The software framework shall run independent of game implementation, allowing game implementations to be "pluged in" as services, through provided interfaces.
			<Req_3> All software components shall communicate through a centeralized event system.
			<Req_4> The software shall provide secure clustering/load-balancing support.
			<Req_5> The software shall instantiate and handle network connections at a low-level.
			<Req_6> The software shall instantiate and handle database connections.
			<Req_7> The software shall provide spatial management utilities.
			<Req_8> The software shall provide game simulation utilities.
			<Req_9> Network Object Attributes will automatically be updated over the network at a specific "tick" interval.
			<Req_10> The software shall be operated on a "tick"-system, which will allow the software components to keep in-sync.
			<Req_11> The software shall logging capabilities that will track errors and log debug statements.
			
		<big><b>3.2.2 An Empire Divided ( Publish 14 Modules )</b></big>
			
		<big><b>3.2.3 Jump to Lightspeed ( Publish 14 Modules )</b></big>

		<big><b>3.2.4 Portal/Adminitration Tools</b></big>
			
		<big><b>3.2.5 SWGSDK</b></big>
	
	<big><u>3.3 Performance Requirements</u></big>
	
	<big><u>3.4 Design Constraints</u></big>
	
		<big><u>3.4.1 Availability</u></big>
			OpenGalaxies is an Open Source product. Anyone can pick up the source code and compile it. 
			Every so interval, a release version of the software suite will be released.
		
		<big><u>3.4.2 Security</u></big>
		
		<big><u>3.4.3 Maintainability</u></big>
			Modification of the servers functionality can be accomplished through plugins, modules, and additional services. Content Developers can construct game content
			through scripting and provided tools.
